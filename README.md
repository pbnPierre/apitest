# Mini REST API
This is a basic front controller redirect all requests on `web/index.php`  
Sorry for all the `DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR`. I code it on windows :shame: but with them it will be portable   
You will find a postman collection in `Deezer.postman_collection.json` file to see all possible url for the API  
You will find DB model in `data/dataFixture.php`, as you will see I used *SQLITE* instead of *MySQL* and I apologize for that :shame:  
All source code will be in src folder under the namespace Deezer  
For the record I made it in aproximately 9 hours of work  
For exercise 2 see `/front` and enjoy my lovely taste for video game music  (You must listen to furi sondtrack it is godlike)
